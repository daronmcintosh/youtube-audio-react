  ☐ implement a better logic for switching play pause button
  ☐ disable highlighting on seekbar
  ☐ fix error where user seeks a lot on a section that isn't buffered and results in some type of infinite loop. Causes the web page to slow down drastically until refresh
  ☐ fix this:Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request. It happens when you skip a track while the current is still loading
  ☐ Home component should get country trending videos by IP and set that country name in this component
  ☐ use same method used in Results component to get seemingly higher resolution images on main page
  ☐ HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT causes ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCHED or vice versa.
