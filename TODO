youtube-audio-react:
  UI:
    ☐ Widen search bar
    ☐ Give the website a more modern feel, material design with a dark theme(https://material-ui.com/)
      ☐ Use material ui's snackbar or the below
        https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify
      ☐ Refractor css to use css grid and/or css flex
      ☐ Use One Dark colors or the default if it looks good
      ☐ Ensure that the context menu follows this same theme
    ☐ Conditional context menu only for videos and playlists and NOT for channels
    ☐ Hide player till something is requested to be played
    ☐ Add an error notification to send messages from server to client
      Use socket.io to communicate and a snackbar to display

  Features:
    ☐ Implement playlists
      ☐ Create feature to add a whole playlist to the queue
    ☐ Implement channels
      ☐ Show a list of playlists and videos
    ☐ Use intro.js or something similar to give new users an introduction to the different features
      Save a cookie that simple says newUser:true in the client's browser to determine
      whether to give introduction or look in intro.js docs if they have something already
    ☐ Create a login/registration page and allow users to link their youtube accounts to their accounts
    ☐ Home component should get country trending videos by IP and set that country name in this component
    ☐ Use related videos to continue playing songs when the nothing is left in the queue

  Bugs:
    ☐ Fix error where user seeks a lot on a section that isn't buffered and results in some type of infinite loop.
      Causes the web page to slow down drastically until refresh
    ☐ Fix this:Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request.
      It happens when you skip a track while the current is still loading
    ☐ HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT causes ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCHED or vice versa.
    ☐ Duplicate requests made when searching

  Enhancements:
    ☐ Everything that gets plays has to go through the queue first
    ☐ Clean up ffmpeg processes that are not in use(socket.io)
    ☐ Check all dependencies to make sure they are being used and needed(script tags included)
    ☐ Update all dependencies to the latest versions
    ☐ Implement a better logic for switching play pause button
    ☐ Use same method used in Results component to get seemingly higher resolution images on main page

  Development:
    ✔ Consider publishing stream.js since it shares code between two projects and it would make it easier to maintain @done(19-05-11 16:05)
      Published to the npm registry under the package name @isolution/youtube-audio-stream
    ✘ Implement live streams into youtube-audio-stream by submitting a pull request @cancelled(19-05-11 16:05)
      ✘ Use ytld.getInfo() to retrieve meta data and return that in the 'stream' object (stream.info) @cancelled(19-05-11 16:05)
        Use the url from the format that is chosen so that livestreams and normal videos work out of the box
        The only thing that is really needed in info is whether or not it is a live stream, content length
