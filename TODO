  ☐ disable step-backward and/or step-forward until the user has songs in the queue to do each action
  ☐ create a login/registration page and allow users to link their youtube accounts to their accounts
  ☐ should the ability to play be separate from from the home and results component?
    for example to play a single song instead of adding it to the queue
  ☐ conditional context menu only for videos and playlists and NOT for channels
  ☐ add a whole playlist to the queue
  ☐ implement a better logic for switching play pause button
  ☐ fix error where user seeks a lot on a section that isn't buffered and results in some type of infinite loop. Causes the web page to slow down drastically until refresh
  ☐ fix this:Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request. It happens when you skip a track while the current is still loading
  ☐ Home component should get country trending videos by IP and set that country name in this component
  ☐ use same method used in Results component to get seemingly higher resolution images on main page
  ☐ HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT causes ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCHED or vice versa.
