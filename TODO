    for example to play a single song instead of adding it to the queue
    on spotify, they just add everything to the 'queue' whether it be search, playlists, or radio; you are unable to play a single song
    for now I will just avoid adding everything to the queue just to give it a youtube feel
  ☐ conditional context menu only for videos and playlists and NOT for channels
  ☐ implement a hover effect for 'show more' for each 'playable item' on website
    show more should just pop up the right click context menu
    playable items are videos, playlists, livestreams
  ☐ create feature to add a whole playlist to the queue
  ☐ implement a better logic for switching play pause button
  ☐ create a login/registration page and allow users to link their youtube accounts to their accounts
  ☐ fix error where user seeks a lot on a section that isn't buffered and results in some type of infinite loop. Causes the web page to slow down drastically until refresh
  ☐ fix this:Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request. It happens when you skip a track while the current is still loading
  ☐ Home component should get country trending videos by IP and set that country name in this component
  ☐ use same method used in Results component to get seemingly higher resolution images on main page
  ☐ HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT causes ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCHED or vice versa.
